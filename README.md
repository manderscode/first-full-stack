# Sad Girl Cafe - Full-Stack Web Application

This is a full-stack web application where a barista is able to enter the customer's email, name, and their coffee order. Once the order has been completed, the barista can click on the checkmark to mark it as "done". If the order was wrong, it can be deleted.

## Languages Used 

This was created using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Express, Node.js, and MongoDB.

## Lessons Learned 

The most challenging aspect of this project was figuring out how to mark the orders as "done" after the barista clicked on the checkmark icon. I feel more confident in writing for loops in my EJS files.
